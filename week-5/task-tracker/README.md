## 📖 About the Project

This Task Tracker app was developed for AUTOWAVE Week 5 intern training. It demonstrates core React concepts such as functional components, props, local state with the `useState` hook, and modern styling using Tailwind CSS. TypeScript is used throughout for strong typing of props and component state.

Key features include:
- Add and remove tasks
- Component-based architecture using React
- Props passed between parent and child components
- Local state management with `useState`
- Fully responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Type-safe props and component state
- Deployed using Cloudflare Pages

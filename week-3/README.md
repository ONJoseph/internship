## 📖 About the Project

This is a fully functional Interactive Calculator App developed for AUTOWAVE Week 3 intern training. It performs basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — and dynamically updates the display in response to user interactions via DOM manipulation.

The application is built with vanilla JavaScript, styled using Tailwind CSS, and demonstrates key JavaScript concepts such as:

- Functions & control structures

- DOM selection & event handling

- User interactivity and real-time updates

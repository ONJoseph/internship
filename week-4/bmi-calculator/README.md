## 📖 About the Project

This BMI Calculator app was developed for AUTOWAVE Week 4 intern training, demonstrating key TypeScript concepts including type-safe form input handling, interfaces, generics, and strong typing.

Key features include:
- User inputs for height and weight with type-safe handling
- Dynamic BMI calculation with category interpretation (underweight, normal, overweight)
- Fully type-safe code with reusable types and generic functions
- DOM interactions typed explicitly with `HTMLInputElement`
- Deployed on GitHub Pages
